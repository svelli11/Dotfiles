No personal information is sent\\nto third-party APIs or websites when gathering information.\\n\\nClients request link information from our own API, sending only the exact link requested\\nwithout any context such as the channel the client is viewing at the time. Our server\\nmakes requests from third-party APIs and websites on the behalf of the client and formats\\nthe data for clients to display.\\n\\nWe use the APIs of the following services for scraping link information:\\n\\n* Discord ([Terms of Service](https://discordapp.com/terms), [Developer Terms of Service](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/legal))\\n* Gyazo ([Terms of Service](https://gyazo.com/doc/terms))\\n* Imgur ([Terms of Service](https://imgur.com/tos))\\n* Pretzel Rocks ([Terms of Service](https://www.pretzel.rocks/terms))\\n* Splits.io\\n* Strawpoll.me ([Terms of Service](https://www.curse.com/terms-of-service))\\n* Twitch ([Terms of Service](https://www.twitch.tv/p/legal/terms-of-service/), [Developer Agreement](https://www.twitch.tv/p/legal/developer-agreement/))\\n* Twitter ([Terms of Service](https://twitter.com/en/tos), [Developer Terms](https://developer.twitter.com/en/more/developer-terms.html))\\n* xkcd\\n* YouTube ([Terms of Service](https://www.youtube.com/t/terms), [Developer Terms of Service](https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/developer-policies), [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy))\\n\\nIn addition to scraping via APIs, our link information reads standard metadata tags from\\nHTML responses to support a wide array of other websites.\\n\\n### Link Thumbnails\\n\\nThumbnail images for links are proxied through our own servers to avoid leaking user IP\\naddresses or other HTTP headers to third-party servers.
