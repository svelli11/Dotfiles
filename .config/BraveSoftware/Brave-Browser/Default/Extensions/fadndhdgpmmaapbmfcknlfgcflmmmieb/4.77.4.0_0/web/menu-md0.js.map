Unfortunately, a few features are impractical to update on the new version of Twitch's website.\\n\\nMany features are still planned to return as the developers have time to implement them. There is no schedule of pending features. Features are released immediately upon completion.\\n\\n* *I've donated, but my badge doesn't show up.*\\n* *I added an emote to my channel but I don't see it.*\\n\\nDue to performance problems with our current website, we have to use caching on our API. Because of this, it can take up to half an hour for changes made to badges or emotes to take effect. After waiting, refresh the page and your content should appear. You can also try performing a hard refresh.\\n\\n* *I don't want the `FFZ Supporter` badge.*\\n\\nUsers can toggle the visibility of their FFZ badges at: [https://www.frankerfacez.com/settings/profile](https://www.frankerfacez.com/settings/profile)\\n\\n* *I can see my emotes, but someone in chat said they can't.*\\n\\nUsers need FrankerFaceZ installed, or another third-party client that supports FFZ emotes, to see emotes from FrankerFaceZ. Users might also not see newly added emotes, depending on their browser cache and when they last refreshed.\\n\\n* *There's a stolen emote!*\\n* *There's an offensive emote!*\\n\\nPlease report any issues with emotes using the `Report Emote` tool on our website. Shift-Click the offending emote to open it's page, and select `Report Emote` in the right side-bar. You'll need to sign in to report an emote.\";\n\n/***/ })\n\n}]);"],"names":["module"],"sourceRoot":""}
